# Security-Site
## What is this about?
This repo is to showcase all the homeworks and projects we do in our Cyber Security class in one big website! It'll utilize the python functions we make for our homeworks like libraries and provide the capability for a user to access and use it.
Most of these homeworks will require us to utilize the command line to actually use it, but there would be no reason that it couldn't be repurposed to use in APIs in Flask or another lightweight API framework for Python

## Planned Sections
- Home Page
- Services
- Papers / Essays
- Links to other websites

## Stack
- Frontend:
- Backend: Python (Either Flask, Pyramid, Django, or FastAPI)
- Css: Either Bootstrap or Tailwind
